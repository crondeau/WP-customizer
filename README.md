WP Customizer
====================

Code snippet that allows you to add social media icons to your theme customizer. 
The social media icons can be displayed using a sprite or icon fonts. 
The code supplied here uses genericons, but you may want to grab an up-to date copy of genericons
since new icons are added regularly.

For an example of their use see Mon Cahier http://themes.bluelimemedia.com/mon-cahier/
